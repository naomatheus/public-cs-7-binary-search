# Search Algorithms

## Overview
In this lesson, I learned how the binary search algorithm works to find information efficiently and elegantly.

There were two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Search Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/633)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Binary Search](exercises/searches.js)


## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the Big O complexities of brute force and binary search approaches.
- Describe how binary search works.
- Write a binary search algorithm to find a value in an array.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Recursion
* Intro to Sorting Algorithms

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class
* Many many hours outside of class
